# emiAI

emiAI is a framework for the "inversion" of electromagnetic 
induction imaging (EMI) data based on a deep learning network written in Python using
Keras and Tensorflow. It covers the generation training data, the training and evaluation of the deep learning (DL) network and the 
prediction of 1D vertical electrical conductivity (EC) models from measured 
vertical coplanar (VCP) apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) data. 

The framework basically takes care of the following steps:
1. Generation of training models for the deep learning network from electrical
resistivity data. The training models consist of 3 measured VCP ECa values and 
EC depth models with 4, 6 and 12 depth layers.
2. Training and evaluation of the DL network
3. Prediction of the 1D vertical EC models.
