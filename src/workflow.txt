01 - generate the pseudo random 1D EC models from ERT data 
02 - downsample and aggregate the models into composite model 
03 - do the forward modelling and prepare data set for DL network 
04 - train the DL network 
05 - predict EC models from 3 VCP values 

01_generate_1Dmodels.py
Generates pseudo-random 1D EC models based on ERT sections, does downsampling 
and aggregation. See config.json for settings. 

02_compute_forward_response.py 
For the generated EC models compute the forward response as VCP and HCP with 
EMagPy. 

03_DLN_train.py 
Train the deep learning network, sequentially for the three subnets and save 
the training statistics and models. 

04_DLN_predict.py 
Do the prediction for a field dataset and plot the results.
